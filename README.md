# Playing with .NET Core gRPC
Try out the .NET Core client and server gRPC Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. This can be a good fit for high-performance or streaming communication between microservices.

#### In this example

`Grpc.Demo.ProtoLib`

- Contains the proto file in a common library for the client and server projects

`Grpc.Demo.WebServer`

- gRPC server implementation (unary call, throw RpcException, server and client streaming, using enum and timestamp types)

`Grpc.Demo.ConsoleClient`

- gRPC client implementation

`Grpc.Demo.WorkerServiceClient`

- gRPC client implementation using *worker service* and *gRPC client factory*
