# Playing with .NET Core gRPC
Try out the .NET Core client and server gRPC Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. This can be a good fit for high-performance or streaming communication between microservices.

#### In this example

`Grpc.Demo.ProtoLib`

- Contains the proto file in a common library for the client and server projects
- CertificateStore.cs: It is used to read the certificate from the Current User Store

`Grpc.Demo.WebServer`

- gRPC server implementation (unary call, throw RpcException, server and client streaming, define enum and timestamp types)
- Implement *Certificate Authentication*. You can use the *MakeCerts.ps1* to create development client a server certificates

`Grpc.Demo.ConsoleClient`

- gRPC client implementation for console application

`Grpc.Demo.WorkerServiceClient`

- gRPC client implementation for *worker service* using *gRPC client factory*
